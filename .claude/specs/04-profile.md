# Spec 04: Profile Page (Hardcoded UI Data)

## Overview

- This step replaces the `/profile` stub with a fully designed profile page showing static, hardcoded data.
- The goal is to establish the complete UI layout before any real DB queries are wired up in Step 05.
- Four sections to build: user info card, summary stats, transaction history table, category breakdown.
- Building UI first lets the team validate design in isolation and ensures templates are ready for the backend-connection step.

## Depends on

- Step 01 — Database setup (schema must exist)
- Step 02 — Registration (user accounts must be creatable)
- Step 03 — Login + Logout (session must be set; `/profile` must be a protected route)

## Routes

- `GET /profile` — render the profile page — logged-in only (redirect to `/login` if not authenticated)

## Database changes

- No database changes.
- The existing `users` and `expenses` tables are sufficient.
- No DB queries in this step — all data is hardcoded.

## Templates

- Create: `templates/profile.html` — full profile page extending `base.html`.
- Must contain four sections:
  1. User info card — avatar initials, name, email, member-since date (all hardcoded values)
  2. Summary stats row — total spent, number of transactions, top category (all hardcoded values)
  3. Transaction history table — list of recent expenses with date, description, category badge, amount (at least 3 hardcoded rows)
  4. Category breakdown — per-category totals as a simple list or progress-bar rows (at least 3 hardcoded categories)

## Files to change

- `app.py` — replace `/profile` stub with a real view function that:
  - redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`
  - passes hardcoded context variables (user dict, stats dict, expenses list, category breakdown list) to `profile.html`

## Files to create

- `templates/profile.html`

## New dependencies

- None

## Rules for implementation

- No SQLAlchemy or ORMs — use raw `sqlite3` via `get_db()` if any DB call is ever needed.
- Parameterised queries only — never string-format SQL.
- Authentication guard: check `session.get("user_id")`; if absent, `redirect(url_for("login"))`.
- All data passed to the template must be hardcoded Python dicts/lists in `app.py` — no DB queries in this step.
- Use CSS variables — never hardcode hex values.
- No inline styles anywhere in `profile.html`.
- All templates must extend `base.html`.
- Category badges must use a CSS class, not inline colour styles.
- Use `url_for()` for every internal link — never hardcode paths.

## Definition of done

- [ ] Visiting `/profile` without being logged in redirects to `/login`
- [ ] Visiting `/profile` while logged in returns HTTP 200
- [ ] The page displays a user info card with a name and email
- [ ] The page displays at least three summary stat values (e.g. total spent, transaction count, top category)
- [ ] The page displays a transaction history table with at least three hardcoded rows
- [ ] The page displays a category breakdown section with at least three categories
- [ ] The navbar shows the logged-in state (username + logout link)
- [ ] No hex colour values appear in `profile.html` — only CSS variables
